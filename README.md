I am a machine learning specialist with experience the field of finance. Most of my contributions are unfortunately private, but I do have some "extra-curricular" projects for which I created public repositories. These repos essentially revolve around either finance or the "Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus" challenge.

### Here is my list of public projects:
* [CountingWithTransformers](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/CountingWithTransformers): these scripts are the companion code to my paper "Counting and Algorithmic Generalization with Transformers" which I recently submitted. Review pending.
* [ARC_gym](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/ARC_gym): a framework in development to help generate training data for the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus challenge. Currently only focuses on cardinality concepts.
* [Microstructure](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/Microstructure): a framework in development to help generate simulated financial data, to evaluate algorithms & approaches to ML trading.
* [RLNonStationary](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/RLNonStationary): companion code for a talk I gave at Quantopian about using simulated data to train a reinforcement learning algorithm when non-stationarity is a problem.
