Most of my contributions are unfortunately private, but I do have some "extra-curricular" projects for which I created public repositories. These repos essentially revolve around either finance or the "Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus" challenge.

### Here is my list of public projects:
* [GridCoder 2024](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/GridCoder2024): my code submission to ARC Prize 2024 and the companion code to my paper ["Towards Efficient Neurally-Guided Program Induction for ARC-AGI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17708). It is a series of experiments on the generalization capabilities of neurally-guided program induction in the context of the ARC-AGI problem domain.
* [CountingWithTransformers](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/CountingWithTransformers): these scripts are the companion code to my paper ["Counting and Algorithmic Generalization with Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08661).
* [ARC_gym](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/ARC_gym): a framework in development to help generate training data for the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus challenge.
* [MLC-ARC_gym](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/MLC-ARC_gym): an experiment that applies the MLC method (Lake & Baroni (2023)), a meta-learning Transformer, on the ARC gym.
* [Microstructure](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/Microstructure): a framework in development to help generate simulated financial data, to evaluate algorithms & approaches to ML trading.
* [RLNonStationary](https://github.com/SimonOuellette35/RLNonStationary): companion code for a talk I gave at Quantopian about using simulated data to train a reinforcement learning algorithm when non-stationarity is a problem.
